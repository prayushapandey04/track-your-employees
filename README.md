## Installation

Requires Node.js

## Usage

When you open the CLI, make sure you open the server.js file and do "node server.js" so the application is initialized and starts up. Then, you will be asked a series of questions of departments, names, and positions that you can check for your employees. You will also be able to update roles, departments, and add departments and roles all through your CLI. This should update the database as you make changes.
